You can tell, from the environment, what kind of creature lives here: the Rey Dau, a horned wyvern that commands the elements. You've seen it before, when it appeared unexpectedly while you were out on another expedition, descending from lightning-streaked skies to sink its claws into an unfortunate pack of shaggy, lion-like creatures.

A camera that could detect your gestures and replicate them on-screen in a game, the Kinect allowed players to control video games with their bodies. It was initially a sensation, selling 1m units in its first 10 days ; it remains the fastest-selling gaming peripheral ever . However, a lack of games, unreliable performance and a motion-control market already monopolised by the Nintendo Wii caused enthusiasm for the Kinect to quickly cool. Microsoft released a new version of the Kinect with the Xbox One in 2013 , only for it to become an embarrassing flop; the Kinect line was unceremoniously discontinued in 2017 . The Guardian reached out to multiple people involved in the development of the peripheral, all of whom declined to comment or did not wish to go on record. Instead, the people keenest to discuss Microsoft's motion-sensing camera never used it for gaming at all. Continue reading...",

Age ratings are intended to help parents determine whether or not a game is appropriate for their children. But in practice, an erroneous label doesn't just mislead consumers - it can be the difference between success or failure. Balatro is an award-winning poker game made by an anonymous game developer known as LocalThunk , in which the only guiding principle is chaos. In each match the player must divine the best possible poker hand out of a randomised draw, but the conditions fluctuate constantly. In one round, the game might prevent you from using an entire suit or junk all your face cards, while the next round might challenge you to achieve an eyebrow-raising score with only a single hand. As the game progresses, players accrue jokers for their deck that add yet more wild rules. Continue reading...",

        "Content": "Powered chiefly by enthusiasm and primitive publishing tech, these publications shaped the future of video games media In the summer of 1985, I made the long pilgrimage from my home in Cheadle Hulme to London's glamorous Hammersmith Novotel for the Commodore computer show. As a 14-year-old gamer, this was a chance to play the latest titles and see some cool new joysticks, but I was also desperate to visit one particular exhibitor: the publisher Newsfield, home of the wildly popular games mags Crash and Zzap!64. By the time I arrived there was already a long queue of kids at the small stand and most of them were waiting to have their show programmes signed by reigning arcade game champion and Zzap reviewer, Julian Rignall. As an ardent subscriber, I can still remember the thrill of standing in that line, the latest copy of the mag clutched in my sweaty hands. I wouldn't feel this starstruck again until I met Sigourney Weaver a quarter of a century later. It turns out I'm not the only one who remembers that day. In his wonderful new book, The Games of a Lifetime, Rignall himself recalls the shock of being swamped by fans. “We just didn't expect anything like that,” he writes. “I had no idea readers would be so interested in us. But I loved it.” Continue reading...",

I'm a huge fan of this series and am delighted by the latest entry , but after filing the review last week, I've barely had a minute to play it since it came out. Regular readers will know that this is a familiar problem for me: I have two kids, so my gaming time is tight, and the living room TV is very often in use. I anticipated this, so in the run-up to Monster Hunter Wilds' release, I spent £200 on a PlayStation Portal - essentially a screen sandwiched between two halves of a PlayStation 5 controller. I can't decide whether it's one of the most unwieldy things that Sony has ever come out with, or one of the most elegant. It lets me stream games from my PS5, so the console can be whirring away under the TV and I can be on the sofa with my little screen, swinging a transforming axe at a dreadful octopus .

        "Content": "PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox; Two Point Studios/Sega This humorous management game puts you in charge of creating entertaining displays on everything from natural history to the paranormal All was quiet at the County Archives Museum, until a woman erupted from one of the toilets. Clad in full scuba gear, she would have gone unnoticed as she weaved among the usual visitors - a bored gaggle of schoolchildren, tourists, and a yeti - were it not for a beady eyed security guard. The woman, it turns out, was a member of an infamous crime syndicate, renowned for breaking into museums, stealing priceless exhibits and slipping back into the sewers like a well-renumerated goldfish. As my security guard tackled the thief, the museum's prehistory expert neatly sidestepped the fray and departed for a far-flung corner of the Earth, soon to return with a prized relic of the ancient world. Burglars get caught; museums just hire better qualified thieves and send them on expeditions. This is the kind of whimsical satire that Two Point Studios trades on, making delightful and irreverent management games that poke fun at very serious establishments: hospitals, universities, and now museums. Here, as the curator of the county's timeworn institutions, you must protect profit first and history second. Easier said than done when there's so much to manage: you must hire experts to source and maintain exhibits, assistants to run front-of-house, janitors to scrape stubborn substances from floors, and security guards to handle donations and play whack-a-mole with criminals.
